# Customer-Churn-Analysis
📉 Customer Churn Prediction
This project predicts the likelihood of customer churn using telecom customer data and machine learning.
It contains a Jupyter Notebook with data exploration, feature analysis, and predictive model development for churn classification.

📁 Project Structure
customer-churn.ipynb → Jupyter Notebook for data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model building.

Customer Churn.csv → Dataset containing customer demographics, service usage details, and churn labels.

🚀 Features
Loaded and preprocessed customer usage and demographic data.

Performed in-depth exploratory data analysis to understand churn patterns.

Built machine learning classification models to predict customer churn.

Evaluated model performance and identified key drivers of churn.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy (data manipulation)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (data visualization)

Scipy (statistical analysis)

Jupyter Notebook (interactive experimentation)

▶️ How to Run
1️⃣ Clone Repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-churn-prediction.git
cd customer-churn-prediction
📊 Usage
The notebook loads the Customer Churn.csv data file and conducts cleaning and preprocessing.

Exploratory analysis visualizes churn distribution across demographic and service-related features.

Model training cells build classification models to predict churn status.

Performance metrics and visualizations help interpret model accuracy and influential features.

📈 Results
Insights into demographics and service factors that influence customer churn.

Machine learning models provide effective prediction with interpretable feature importance.
